            "content": "The Five Nights at Freddy's movie has a release date and it's coming very soon. One of the long gestating video game adaptations has been the Five Nights at Freddy's movie. The horror game exploded in popularity in the 2010s when YouTubers started doing let's plays of the game. The first game sees you playing as a security guard in a Chuck E. Cheese-like restaurant, monitoring cameras to make sure nothing is going bump in the night. However, it turns out the animatronic characters in the building are actually alive and are evil. The series went on to spawn numerous games and the series has been riding a high ever since, with many hoping it would eventually come to the big screen. Earlier this year, the film finally went into production and after a few months of filming, it has wrapped.Now, fans are wondering when they'll get to see it and the answer is... very soon! Producer Jason Blum has confirmed that Five Nights at Freddy's will release in theaters and on Peacock on Friday, October 27th, 2023. A new screenshot was also released to celebrate the news. The film will follow the same premise of the first game and follow a security guard trying to survive the night at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Blumhouse has a history of releasing its big releases in October and also doing a day and date streaming release on Peacock and it seems like Five Nights at Freddy's will continue to follow this trend. As promised:#FNAF FANS: You asked and we delivered. #FNAFMovie is coming this Halloween on October 27. 2023!!!!!205 days until the party.And that is the BIG NEWS-- Jason Blum (@jason_blum) April 6, 2023 First look at the live-action 'FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYS' movie.The film releases on October 27. pic.twitter.com/kaR3iGJSVI-- DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) April 6, 2023 As of right now, it's unclear when we'll get the first trailer for the film, but with a release date fast approaching, it can't be too far off. The Five Nights at Freddy's movie will star the likes of Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, and is also co-written by series creator Scott Hawthorn. The film will also feature animatronics from Jim Henson's Creature Shop, which will hopefully give them a great deal of authenticity. Are you excited for Five Nights at Freddy's?

            "description": "The film is just a soulless ploy to sell us merchandise and comes off like a video game we’re unable to play.",
            "content": "Before a recent screening of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” began, a fan sitting in front of me donned his red Mario cap and beamed with excitement. Ten minutes into the film, his hat came off and his enthusiasm came down. Because he realized that we were all, once again, actually watching “Intellectual Property The Movie.” For all its detailed worlds, like the Mushroom Kingdom and Jungle Kingdom, the Nintendo film is just another soulless ploy to sell us merchandise that doesn’t bother to disguise its creativity-starved greed. Mostly the movie comes off like a video game we’re unable to play. Running time: 104 minutes. Rated PG (action and mild violence). In theaters. I’d much rather drive the race cars of Mario Kart at home than watch a dull CGI chase scene in an overlong kids flick. The mind-numbingly obvious story starts out in Brooklyn, where Mario ( voiced by Chris Pratt ) and Luigi (Charlie Day) work as plumbers. It’s a realistic setting. I spot mustachioed guys wearing overalls in Williamsburg all the time. But perhaps the boys would be better off selling artisan beard oil on Bedford, because they’re not very good with their socket wrenches. One bully calls the duo “Brooklyn’s favorite failures.” Their cringy, “It’s-a me!” Italian accents, we learn, were briefly faked for a “Ghostbusters”-style commercial to hawk their struggling business. But in reality, they talk like normal, very boring dudes. And, rising to the occasion, Pratt and Day provide their characters with very boring voices. While trying to fix a water main break downtown, the pair are sucked into a magic pipe and whisked to the world of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Bowser (Jack Black) and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key). It’s a kind of “The Lion, The Witch and the Nintendo” situation. Mario winds up in Peach’s Mushroom Kingdom, while Luigi is plopped in the Dark Lands that Bowser lords over. Mario enlists the princess’ help to find his brother, and she asks him and Toad to protect her and her people from evil Bowser, who wants to get married to her. In New York, they’re talentless plumbers — here, they’re heroes. All the characters make moronic comments that aren’t funny enough to be called jokes. For instance, Bowser announces to the audience’s silence: “I am now the most powerful turtle in the world! Soon we will arrive at the Mushroom Kingdom!” And the princess isn’t exactly a MENSA candidate, either. “There’s a huge universe out there,” she says. “With a lot of galaxies.” On their predictable quest, they team up with Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen), drive on the rainbow road and use power-up cubes from the video games to give ‘em a boost. If you’re looking for a clever spin on anything, stay home and make a BBQ pizza. Even the starry voice cast is a let-down. Pratt, Taylor-Joy, Key and Rogen sound blander than a telemarketer on a Tuesday. Black at least shows a glimmer of his tenacious self, but even he isn’t half as uproarious as he usually is. Toy and game films aren’t an abomination by nature. “Pokemon Detective Pikachu” was a fun take, and the first “Sonic the Hedgehog” was a solid adventure flick. “ Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves ,” out now, is hugely enjoyable. But “Super Mario,” directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, is an ad to sell games and merch — nothing more. It’s not as horrible as “ UglyDolls ” or “ Pixels ” or “ The Emoji Movie ,” but that’s not the sort of compliment you can slap on a poster. In short, “Super Mario Bros.” is da-da-da-duh-da-da — dumb!",

            "description": "The father-daughter duo recreated the iconic moment when Milania, then 4, called Joe an “old troll” while begging for pizza on the hit Bravo series.",
            "content": "Milania and Joe Giudice took a trip down memory lane while recreating an old scene from “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” In a short clip posted to TikTok Tuesday, the father-daughter duo reenacted the iconic moment Milania, now 17, called Joe, 50, an “old troll” while begging for pizza. “Give me pizza! Give me pizza!” Milania lip-synched to the audio. ”Give me pizza you old troll!” Milania, who wore a strapless floral dress while visiting her dad in the Bahamas, couldn’t help but laugh while channeling her 4-year-old self. Similar to his reaction at the time, Joe seem unfazed by the whole ordeal. Although the businessman might not have remembered the classic “RHONJ” scene, Milania’s followers reflected on some of the pair’s finest moments in the comments section. “LMAO one of the best scenes ever in the Real Housewives series,” one fan gushed, with another adding, “I remember when you called him a poopy head😂. I love yalls relationship.” A third user joked, “You tortured him when you were little 😂😂. he’s so funny I miss him on the show.” Joe has rarely appeared on the hit series ever since starting his three-year prison sentence for fraud in 2016. He spent another seven months in an ICE detention center . After he was released in 2019, Joe was deported to his native Italy, only to relocate to the Bahamas two years later to be closer to his family. Joe and Teresa Giudice ended up getting divorced in 2020 after 20 years of marriage due to the distance. However, their four daughters — Gia, 22, Gabriella, 19, Milania and Audriana, 13 — have maintained a relationship with their father, even fighting to get him back on US soil. Gia – who is currently studying criminal justice and sociology at Rutgers University – told Page Six in February that a major “goal” in her budding legal career is to have his immigration status “reevaluated.” “It is hard for everybody to see him, rather than just one person being able to come here, like during holidays or birthdays, would just be like a dream come true,” she told us, noting that Joe was never “a flight risk” or “a threat to society.” “I just feel like that if that whole aspect of it can get reevaluated, that maybe he could have a chance of coming back temporarily here and there.”",

            "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email view in app This story first appeared on Food52 , an online community that gives you everything you need for a happier kitchen and home – that means tested recipes, a shop full of beautiful products, a cooking hotline, and everything in between! When I think of my favorite food memories, my mind goes a million different directions at once. There's the green Shrek-themed ketchup that my sister begged my dad to buy on one of our family shopping trips. I was maybe 9, she was maybe 6 and whenever we were at his house for the week, he'd let us pick out one junk food item each. It was thrilling to say the least. (My sister ate that ketchup exactly one time and then it was banished to the back of the fridge for entirely too long.) There's the unparalleled experience of eating a fresh batch of Fisher's Popcorn after spending a morning playing in the waves in Rehoboth Beach, Del., fingers pruny and salted from the ocean, mind at ease because summer vacation was in full swing. There's my grandma's potato salad that she made whenever we had a crab boil, birthday or other family gathering, forever insisting on Helman's over Duke's. There's the beautifully charred, impossibly flavorful flank steak my mom would grill and serve alongside a too-big salad and plenty of other fixin's when the weather was nice and she had time to cook dinner after a full day in her catering kitchen. These memories are a blend of low-brow and (occasional) high-brow foods that make up the whole of my gustatory past — a thrilling culinary joy ride, if you will. Even more thrilling? Discovering that one of your core food memories is shared by an acquaintance, maybe a coworker or a classmate or the guy you met on Tinder six years ago and then ended up marrying (happy anniversary, Nick). Slap those memorable dishes on an article of clothing and you've basically got a walking billboard for food nostalgia — that's Rachel Antonoff 's latest line of edible-themed garments in a nutshell. Rachel founded her eponymous fashion brand in 2008, releasing her first line a year later. Over the decade plus since the brand has been around, there have been a few constants: inclusive sizing, ethical production, garments that are actually comfortable to wear and irreverent prints that either perplex or delight (or both) and often feature food. From an internet-breaking pasta puffer to a key lime pie print created from Rachel's latest baking obsession, I sat down with the designer to talk all things food, fashion and inspiring trips to Florida. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. MADISON TRAPKIN: ​​Can you describe your ideal lunch date? Where are you going? What are you eating and what are you wearing? RACHEL ANTONOFF: Can I be anywhere? And can I be a bummer? MT: Yes and yes. RA: So, there are a few versions. My mind immediately goes to Paris because it's just my favorite place to eat. I'd probably be having roast chicken with French fries with a lot of mustard to dip both in. I don't know exactly where, but I feel like that's one of the things about chicken in Paris — you can sit down almost anywhere and it's going to be great. The bummer is, I was thinking the first person I'd want to have lunch with would be my sister. She's dead, but it would be really fun to see her. I'm so sorry. MT: Don't apologize! I think that's really beautiful. RA: Actually, I want to revise that because I feel like it would be so great to see her that it would be too distracting. I guess then the next person would be my brother because we both love food and there's zero pressure to maintain a conversation. My friend Fred is my current favorite eating buddy. We were actually just in Paris at the same time and so I know for a fact that he's just a perfect eating friend. MT: And he's down to eat a chicken with you anywhere. RA: He's down to eat anything anywhere. With Fred, we'd be in Long Beach Island, New Jersey at the Holiday Snack Bar . It's a single, circular counter in this very small house. They have burgers and grilled cheese and then right in the middle of the counter is this table filled with the most beautiful cakes you've ever seen. Not even fancy beautiful, just like a chocolate cake with white icing, a vanilla cake with chocolate icing. Like a Bruce Bogtrotter in Matilda situation. MT: Basically the most picture-perfect chocolate cake you've ever seen in your life. What are you wearing to this lunch date? RA: Well, I can tell you what I'm not wearing, which is anything with an even remotely fitted waist. I can't stand discomfort in general. Eating is so fun and important to me. It's not just something that I do for sustenance, although that is a wonderful byproduct, it's a hobby. And so I always want to make sure when I'm going to dinner — and we really take this into account when we're designing — is like, are you going to be able to really go for it in this outfit? And if not, I don't want to wear it and I don't really want to put it out there either. MT: It's important to be prepared for all things, especially eating. RA: So, what am I wearing? I'm wearing a loose, tent-y dress, one that hovers around you but almost never even touches you and a slide of some sort that took no effort to put on. MT: And you can take a post-meal nap very easily. RA: Exactly. MT: Have you always known that food would find its way into your designs? RA: I always wished it would. We've had a strange journey as a company because we spent a really, really long time dealing with the stuff that we wanted to design versus the stuff that we were being told people wanted from us. The collections used to be heavily divided between what we would call press pieces and sales pieces and the press pieces were the s*** that we were actually excited to make. We figured that no one would actually buy the press pieces and the sales pieces were basically what we thought department stores wanted to buy. Then the pandemic happened and we were fully prepared to go out of business. But that's when something just changed, there was a major attitude shift happening with regard to dressing. People started buying the press pieces, so we pushed the line further and further with things like our seafood tower dress . That was one that we were like, this is going to be very insider baseball, this is just for us. Now it's a best-seller. MT: It is! I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the extended sizing to drop because that dress is my most coveted item. RA: It's coming soon! MT: I agree that there's been a shift in the way we dress in the past few years, more of a mentality of dressing however the f*** you want. I'm really curious to know where the ideas come from for the various food items, like your key lime pie dress . Can you tell me about your process? RA: Well, I'm a truly heinous cook, but a prolific baker. My brother described my cooking perfectly, which is that the best thing I made is something that you would still at least consider sending back at a restaurant. MT: Hell yeah, so nice of him. RA: That's what it is though! So I don't even really bother cooking, but I love to bake. It's a true hobby and it brings me joy. A lot of our design ideas come from whatever I'm baking at the time, but the key lime pie print was the first print where we actually took pictures of a bunch of my pies and used those photos to make the print. I feel really proud because those are actual pies on the dress. MT: What an incredible transformation! The pie goes from being a physical thing to a photo on a screen and then back into a physical thing that someone can wear. It's pretty special. RA: And then you can eat a pie in it! MT: Pie-ception! RA: My key lime pie obsession has been going on for over a year, so there aren't really that many new things to take from my baking because . . . we're still on pie. MT: That's kind of a good problem, right? RA: Actually, my friends and family are legitimately annoyed. I've told them they can say no, that they don't have to taste the pie anymore, but my immediate family still tastes it. My mom's cholesterol is bad now, which she's credited to the baking. MT: What inspired the key lime, specifically? RA: My friend and I went to Florida to visit his parents, which is where I discovered and fell in love with key lime pie. I mean, I always liked it, but I started making them a year ago when we did that. Now that I've started making them for myself — this is hideous to say — but I actually think I like mine better. MT: I think that means you're a pastry chef now? RA: I'll be quoting you on that. MT: Speaking of pastry chefs, I feel like you have so many special connections with people in food. How do you relate to the food industry as a whole? RA: I think the best parts of fashion are the bits that overlap with everything good about food, which is silliness and fun and sharing and community. Whenever I meet someone who actually works in food, it's so cool and exciting to me, I'm just such a fan. Like one of my friends, this guy Alex Hong . He has a restaurant in San Francisco called Sorrel and they just got a Michelin star. It's the sort of food where I don't even understand the sum of whatever the parts were that came to make it, his cooking is so wildly impressive. Otherwise, I'm just a fan of food people, like Caroline Schiff and Nicole Rucker , I'm in awe of their abilities. And yeah, it does inspire me in terms of design. Caroline and I have been talking about doing a baked Alaska piece of some sort. MT: A Baked Alaska collab with Caroline would be so perfect. RA: She also had this great idea of hosting a Seder dinner together. MT: That would be so beautiful! How do cultural traditions like those influence your designs? RA: I think another thing clothes and food have in common is a deep connection to nostalgia. I've noticed that with the stuff we make, there are certain niche foods that are sort of zeitgeisty because they're so nostalgic. Like, we all like French fries, we all like pizza. But there's something about a rainbow cookie that feels like your grandmother's house or a comforting shiva. MT: It's a specificity of time place with foods like the rainbow cookie, while pizza and French fries are really anywhere and everywhere. RA: Exactly. And yeah, we've all come together and decided we like French fries. We know. We get it. But no one's making French fries their personality, whereas I feel like it is very comforting in a lonely world to find that connection point of like, \"Oh, I too love that specific food that is maybe specific to both of our cultures.\" MT: Yeah, absolutely. I think the boom of your wackiest, ultra-specific food designs during COVID, a time when we were all searching for that sort of connectivity, makes so much sense. If we could wear those designs at the same time even though we couldn't physically be together, it was almost like we were still in community with each other in that way. Do you think you'll keep designing food-centric pieces? RA: Definitely, I think those are here to stay for us. I feel like I never know how to predict trends, but I do think that food and animals (as they relate to fashion) are probably never really going anywhere. They're both shared identity things that I think we love to be able to identify in another person, like I'm a cat person or you're a dog person. That connects us. MT: It's almost like you know so much about a person from their favorite food immediately. Like, you love seafood towers ? I know exactly what it would be like to hang out with you. What's your favorite food? And you can't say key lime pie. RA: I couldn't possibly not break it down into categories. I really love a great pancake and I love to push for pancakes for the table, especially when I know that not everyone's going to really want them. MT: You'll eat them mostly. RA: Yeah, I'm absolutely doing that, but if that's not a thing, I will just order the pancakes. It's so fun to be able to go back and forth with different bites of different dishes. MT: To have both the sweet and the savory! RA: Exactly. I've realized as I've gotten older and continue to be single and therefore often exploring this world on my own, I really refuse to not taste all the dishes I want just because I'm eating alone. Granted, this is a very privileged approach, but I got a reservation at Lilia a few weeks ago where it's impossible to even get in the first place, so I wasn't going to go in order and just order one pasta. MT: No, you have to order a lot of things and you will probably take them home and enjoy the leftovers for a long time. RA: That's exactly what I did. I had leftovers for days and it was thrilling. Expensive? Yes. But I don't want to just have the pancakes, metaphorically and literally.

            "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email view in app This Wednesday marks the first day of Passover — or Pesach — which is the annual Jewish festivity that celebrates the Israelites escape from slavery in ancient Egypt. The holiday will be observed for eight days, starting April 5 to April 13. On the first and second nights of Passover, families and friends traditionally enjoy a ceremonial dinner called seder , which means \"order.\" The meal itself is conducted in a specific order that retells the story of liberation from slavery to freedom. There's also plenty of songs, readings, rituals and, of course, spreads of good food. Related 18 best Passover desserts to sweeten your seder A typical seder plate includes six distinct items that have special significance to the story of the Exodus from Egypt. Zeroah, a roasted lamb or goat bone , symbolizes the ancient Passover sacrifice. Beitzah, a roasted egg (usually a hard-boiled egg), symbolizes the festival sacrifice that was offered in the Temple in Jerusalem. Haroset (or charoset), a paste of fruits and nuts, symbolizes the mortar used by Jewish slaves to build the pyramid of the pharaohs. Mar'or, a bitter herb , symbolizes the bitterness and harshness of the slavery. Karpas, a green vegetable (usually parsley or celery) dipped in salt water or vinegar, symbolizes spring . And chazeret, a second bitter herb (usually endive or horseradish ), symbolizes fulfillment. Alongside the plate are three matzos — or unleavened flatbread — that symbolize Jewish resistance and faith. The bread is wrapped in cloth or covered and broken and eaten throughout the evening.

Whether you're attending your very first Passover seder as a guest or hosting your first dinner, seeking out kosher foods can be a daunting task. That's why Trader Joe's is here to help with their selection of Passover-ready menu items! From TJs chicken truffle paté to TJ's mirepoix, here are six tasty products to grab from the store before seder: 01 TJ's All Natural Glatt Kosher Young Turkey A typical seder meal will include several protein dishes, including gefilte fish (poached fish dumplings) or brisket or roast chicken. If you're looking to try a new meat option, look no further than TJ's All Natural Glatt Kosher Young Turkey . Per TJ's, their Kosher turkeys are soaked and salted with a kosher-certified method. They're also priced at just $2.99 per pound! For Passover, enjoy your turkey with a homemade garlic schmaltz, courtesy of this recipe from Jamie Geller. The schmaltz calls for three heads of roasted garlic (squeezed and mashed), extra virgin olive oil, kosher salt, rendered chicken or turkey fat, sprigs of fresh rosemary, sage leaves, flat leaf parsley and sprigs of thyme. 02 TJ's Mirepoix Recommended by the Kitchn's Julie Levine , TJ's mirepoix is a simple mix of onions, carrots and celery that can be used in sauces and marinades. It's quick. It's simple. It's tasty. And, it's just the thing you need when preparing roast lamb for seder! Levine suggests using the mirepoix in braised lamb shanks with shelled peas and lettuce. Of course, you can also make your own mirepoix from scratch. Simply mince a cup of raw carrots, a cup of onions (red and white both work) and a cup of celery. Sauté the cut ingredients in olive oil until they soften. Then add garlic and fresh thyme and sauté until fragrant. 03 TJ's Truffle Mousse Paté Also recommended by Levine, TJ's Truffle Mousse Paté made with chicken is a must-have for Passover appetizers. Priced at $4.99 a pack, the paté is made with chicken liver, sherry wine, mushrooms, 1% truffles and a brandy aspic. The paté pairs especially well with plain matzo or matzo crackers. If the taste of liver is too strong for you, add a a dollop of \"fig jam, stewed cherries or plums,\" per Reddit user u/Efficient-Cricket-72 . 04 TJ's Matzo No Passover foods list is complete without mentioning matzo. And luckily, TJ's now has its own brand of the unleavened flatbread, which is made in Israel and certified kosher. As of March 20, the matzo in question hasn't appeared on TJ's shelves, according to Forward . But a representative for the store confirmed that it exists and will be available soon. Whether you like your matzo sweet or savory, there's plenty of recipes to choose from this Passover. There's a matzo pizza topped with bagged arugula or romaine lettuce, olive oil and TJ's Israeli Feta . There's also matzo toffee, courtesy of this recipe from Food 52's Emma Laperruque. To make the toffee, combine butter and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat and then melt until the mixture is slightly thick, like caramel sauce. Evenly pour the toffee on top of the salted matzos and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle the toffee-coated matzos with chocolate and let cool before enjoying. 05 TJ's Garlic Spread Dip TJ's certified kosher dip is made from a blend of fresh garlic cloves, canola oil, salt and lemon juice. In the same vein as TJ's Truffle Mousse Paté, TJ's Garlic Spread Dip can be slathered on plain matzo and matzo crackers. It can also be basted on roast chicken, turkey, lamb or goat. You can also enjoy it it potato kugel or even matzo ball soup. The possibilities are endless with this delicious dip! 06 TJ's Slightly Coated Dark Chocolate Almonds An important part of seder is dessert, which can include chocolate-matzo layer cake, flourless chocolate cake, chocolate sorbet and chocolate-covered fruits. There's also TJ's Slightly Coated Dark Chocolate Almonds, which are made from dry-roasted California Almonds, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, nonfat dry milk, sea salt and maple sugar. Enjoy the almonds on their own or top them on tricolor chocolate mousse , Torta Caprese (chocolate and almond flourless cake) and Passover ice cream (\"Roca of Affliction\").

            "content": "Contents DOGE community responds to Domino's Dogecoin tweet Is Domino's following Burger King's suit? The U.K. branch of Domino's Pizza has made a surprising Dogecoin mention on its official Twitter account after adding DOGE pictures to their profile picture the day before. The profile picture is back to what it was previously, but they issued a Doge-related tweet that excited the crypto community. Dogemino's — Domino's Pizza UK (@Dominos_UK) April 5, 2023 DOGE community responds to Domino's Dogecoin tweet Over the past two days, the largest meme coin by market cap, DOGE, has been a major point of discussions on Crypto Twitter and on other social media. Elon Musk has again surprised the crypto community by putting up Dogecoin as Twitter's logo instead of the blue bird well known to every Twitter user. #NewProfilePic pic.twitter.com/4ltCZIPmXK — Domino's Pizza UK (@Dominos_UK) April 4, 2023 The price of DOGE soared over 30%, eventually hitting the $0.1 high, which was followed by a mild setback. The number of social mentions of Dogecoin also soared to the 15,000 peak, as reported by U.Today earlier. This, according to analyst Ali Martinez, may cause a major price correction, similar to what happened last year twice — in January and early November. The price dropped by 44% and 50%, respectively. The DOGE community seems to be excited about the Domino's tweet, as many in the comments began asking if they can now buy a pizza for DOGE or simply expressed their excitement about Domino's Pizza tweeting about their favorite meme coin. Related Elon Musk Pushes Dogecoin to Major ATH in Social Volume, But There's a Catch, Watch Out Is Domino's following Burger King's suit? A week ago, Burger King U.K. also made an abrupt DOGE statement on Twitter. Back then, the news spread that the burger chain in Paris had begun to accept Bitcoin. The U.K. branch of the company tweeted \"we need Doge.\" This delighted the meme coin's army. A few days later, Burger King issued another similar tweet, which said: \"Trying to convince my manager to let me have a doge office.\" Back in 2021, Burger King in Brazil started accepting Dogecoin for its Doggper snack and in the fall of the same year, the fast food chain teamed up with Robinhood to make a huge crypto giveaway to U.S. clients in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin. Therefore, these tweets about DOGE from Burger King seem more than simply engagement farming.",

            "content": "Co-founders of The Pickle Lodge in West Chester Twp., the second largest indoor pickleball complex in the country equipped with a full restaurant and bar, hope to partially open their facility by the end of the month, pending proper approval from county regulators.Aprils partial opening is the first of three phases for the 60,000 square-foot facility.Co-Founder Mitch Dunn said his team is currently working with Butler County to open nine of the facilitys 17 courts, which are pretty much ready to go when they give us approval.Dunn told the Journal-News that the remaining eight indoor courts will open sometime this summer, alongside the opening of the newest location of Two Cities Pizza on site, a restaurant founded in Mason in 2015 and winner of Cincinnati Magazines Best Pizza in Cincinnati. The Pickle Lodges outdoor courts are scheduled to open sometime in 2024.The Pickle Lodge offers three different tiers of monthly memberships that grant various perks and access; the options start at $29, $79 and $139 a month.Dunn, who also co-founded the 1,600-member Cincinnati Pickleball Club, said membership signups had exceeded our expectations within the first month of pre-sale.Were very very close, its very exciting, Dunn said. The more Im in the building the more I realize how big this project is. Im in there every day but it still surprises me sometimes.The Pickle Lodge, announced in October 2023, is one of several high-profile West Chester pickleball initiatives.In March, the owner of West Chesters Premier Shooting Tommie Rowland told the Journal-News that she hoped to add outdoor pickleball courts to her commercial property within the next few years. Nearer to Cincinnati, plans were recently announced for an 11-court complex called Aces Pickleball and Kitchen in Norwood.In January, the Journal-News reported that West Chester Trustees were split on a plan to spend $4.6 million on public pickleball courts, similar to the 18-court complex in Middletown, before ultimately putting the plans on hold a decision Dunn said he was grateful for at the time.We love seeing municipalities explore pickleball, Dunn said. [But] I wont kid you, we are glad they are taking that kind of wait-and-see approach because were confident about our ability to meet the needs of players in West Chester.",
